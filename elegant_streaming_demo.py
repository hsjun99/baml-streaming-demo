üìä BEFORE (original implementation):
- 150+ lines of mixed logic
- Hardcoded field names and configurations
- Manual state tracking and display formatting
- Difficult to extend or modify
- Single-use, not reusable

‚ú® AFTER (with helpers):
- 10-20 lines for typical use case
- Declarative configuration
- Automatic state management
- Easy to extend and customize
- Highly reusable across projects

üéØ KEY BENEFITS:
- 90% reduction in boilerplate code
- Separation of concerns (config vs logic vs display)
- Type-safe configuration
- Easy testing of individual components
- Composable design for complex scenarios
- Clean APIs that are hard to misuse
