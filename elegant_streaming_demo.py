üìä BEFORE (FieldConfig approach):
- Separate configuration classes (FieldConfig)
- Dual source of truth (schema + config)
- Manual field mapping and validation
- Complex configuration management
- More boilerplate code

‚ú® AFTER (Schema-driven approach):
- Single source of truth: Pydantic model
- Schema defines both structure AND execution requirements
- Automatic introspection using json_schema_extra
- Type safety built-in with Pydantic
- Clean processor = BAMLStreamProcessor(UserProfile)

üéØ KEY BENEFITS:
- Schema as configuration (single source of truth)
- Pydantic-native approach with full validation
- Zero configuration duplication
- Leverages existing Python ecosystem
- Clean, intuitive API
- Production-ready type safety
