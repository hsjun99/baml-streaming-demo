BAML Streaming with Fast Transitions
====================================

Demonstrates real BAML streaming with fast transitions:
- Progressive field streaming with plain field values
- Event-driven processing with `async for partial in stream:`
- Fast transitions when required fields are ready
- Simple state tracking (none ‚Üí Complete)
- Parallel processing while remaining fields continue streaming
