BAML Streaming with Fast Transitions
====================================

Demonstrates real BAML streaming with fast transitions:
- Progressive field streaming (Pending ‚Üí Incomplete ‚Üí Complete)
- Event-driven processing with `async for partial in stream:`
- Fast transitions when required fields are ready
- Parallel processing while remaining fields continue streaming
